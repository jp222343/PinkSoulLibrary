**The Pink Soul Library Remake**
- This library is a remake of the first Pink Soul library created back in __2015__. The original owner is **u/Kayakazan**, so all the credits should be given to him.

## Why did you make this library?
- I made it due to the original library being removed from its uploaded page, so i decided to recreate it based on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WUHM1Ck5j4&t=22s) that was left on youtube about it.
